# # Amazon Fine Food Reviews Analysis
# 
# 
# Data Source: https://www.kaggle.com/snap/amazon-fine-food-reviews <br>
# 
# EDA: https://nycdatascience.com/blog/student-works/amazon-fine-foods-visualization/
# 
# 
# The Amazon Fine Food Reviews dataset consists of reviews of fine foods from Amazon.<br>
# 
# Number of reviews: 568,454<br>
# Number of users: 256,059<br>
# Number of products: 74,258<br>
# Timespan: Oct 1999 - Oct 2012<br>
# Number of Attributes/Columns in data: 10 
# 
# Attribute Information:
# 
# 1. Id
# 2. ProductId - unique identifier for the product
# 3. UserId - unqiue identifier for the user
# 4. ProfileName
# 5. HelpfulnessNumerator - number of users who found the review helpful
# 6. HelpfulnessDenominator - number of users who indicated whether they found the review helpful or not
# 7. Score - rating between 1 and 5
# 8. Time - timestamp for the review
# 9. Summary - brief summary of the review
# 10. Text - text of the review
# 
# 
# #### Objective:
# Given a review, determine whether the review is positive (rating of 4 or 5) or negative (rating of 1 or 2).
# 
# <br>
# [Q] How to determine if a review is positive or negative?<br>
# <br> 
# [Ans] We could use Score/Rating. A rating of 4 or 5 can be cosnidered as a positive review. A rating of 1 or 2 can be considered as negative one. A review of rating 3 is considered nuetral and such reviews are ignored from our analysis. This is an approximate and proxy way of determining the polarity (positivity/negativity) of a review.

# # [1]. Reading Data

# ## [1.1] Loading the data
# 
# The dataset is available in two forms
# 1. .csv file
# 2. SQLite Database
# 
# In order to load the data, We have used the SQLITE dataset as it is easier to query the data and visualise the data efficiently.
# <br> 
# 
# Here as we only want to get the global sentiment of the recommendations (positive or negative), we will purposefully ignore all Scores equal to 3. If the score is above 3, then the recommendation wil be set to "positive". Otherwise, it will be set to "negative".

# #  [2] Exploratory Data Analysis

# ## [2.1] Data Cleaning: Deduplication
# 
# It is observed (as shown in the table below) that the reviews data had many duplicate entries. Hence it was necessary to remove duplicates in order to get unbiased results for the analysis of the data.  Following is an example:

# In[ ]:


display= pd.read_sql_query("""
SELECT *
FROM Reviews
WHERE Score != 3 AND UserId="AR5J8UI46CURR"
ORDER BY ProductID
""", con)
display.head()


# As it can be seen above that same user has multiple reviews with same values for HelpfulnessNumerator, HelpfulnessDenominator, Score, Time, Summary and Text and on doing analysis it was found that <br>
# <br> 
# ProductId=B000HDOPZG was Loacker Quadratini Vanilla Wafer Cookies, 8.82-Ounce Packages (Pack of 8)<br>
# <br> 
# ProductId=B000HDL1RQ was Loacker Quadratini Lemon Wafer Cookies, 8.82-Ounce Packages (Pack of 8) and so on<br>
# 
# It was inferred after analysis that reviews with same parameters other than ProductId belonged to the same product just having different flavour or quantity. Hence in order to reduce redundancy it was decided to eliminate the rows having same parameters.<br>
# 
# The method used for the same was that we first sort the data according to ProductId and then just keep the first similar product review and delelte the others. for eg. in the above just the review for ProductId=B000HDL1RQ remains. This method ensures that there is only one representative for each product and deduplication without sorting would lead to possibility of different representatives still existing for the same product.

# In[ ]:


#Sorting data according to ProductId in ascending order
sorted_data=filtered_data.sort_values('ProductId', axis=0, ascending=True, inplace=False, kind='quicksort', na_position='last')


# In[ ]:


#Deduplication of entries
final=sorted_data.drop_duplicates(subset={"UserId","ProfileName","Time","Text"}, keep='first', inplace=False)
final.shape


# In[ ]:


#Checking to see how much % of data still remains
(final['Id'].size*1.0)/(filtered_data['Id'].size*1.0)*100


# <b>Observation:-</b> It was also seen that in two rows given below the value of HelpfulnessNumerator is greater than HelpfulnessDenominator which is not practically possible hence these two rows too are removed from calcualtions

display= pd.read_sql_query("""
SELECT *

#Before starting the next phase of preprocessing lets see the number of entries left

# #  [3] Preprocessing

# ## [3.1].  Preprocessing Review Text
# 
# Now that we have finished deduplication our data requires some preprocessing before we go on further with analysis and making the prediction model.
# 
# Hence in the Preprocessing phase we do the following in the order below:-
# 
# 1. Begin by removing the html tags
# 2. Remove any punctuations or limited set of special characters like , or . or # etc.
# 3. Check if the word is made up of english letters and is not alpha-numeric
# 4. Check to see if the length of the word is greater than 2 (as it was researched that there is no adjective in 2-letters)
# 5. Convert the word to lowercase
# 6. Remove Stopwords
# 7. Finally Snowball Stemming the word (it was obsereved to be better than Porter Stemming)<br>
# 
# After which we collect the words used to describe positive and negative reviews

# <h4><font color='red'>Note: Data Leakage</font></h4>
# 
# 1. There will be an issue of data-leakage if you vectorize the entire data and then split it into train/cv/test.
# 2. To avoid the issue of data-leakag, make sure to split your data first and then vectorize it. 
# 3. While vectorizing your data, apply the method fit_transform() on you train data, and apply the method transform() on cv/test data.
